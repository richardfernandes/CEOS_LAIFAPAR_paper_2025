# CEOS_LAIFAPAR_paper_2025
Documents, data and results for CEOS LAI FAPAR validation paper 2025

## Welcome coauthors!  

This repo contains material for the CEOS WGCV Biophysical Group paper "A Methodology for Validating Synoptic Decametric Resolution Satellite Leaf Area Index and fAPAR Products."



The goal is to submit an invited paper **BEFORE February 28, 2026** to the [RSE Specical Issue Development, Validation, and Application of Medium- and High-Resolution Satellite Products at Regional to Global Scales](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/321741/development-validation-and-application-of-medium-and-high-resolution-satellite-products-at-regional-to-global-scales). 



We are going for a paper both for visibility and timeliness.  \
This paper fills a gap in current LPV methods.  \
Once published, the paper and code base would enable us to quickly update the current good practice guide and enhance the ESA Cal/Val portal code.






## **Due December 15, 2025:**

* Please review  the manuscript and save a copy in the same folder without your initials and date as a suffix:
* * indicate general comments and suggest changes to sections, conceptual or theoretical issues, dissenting opinions including if need be new methods.
  * note the scope of the paper - you are most welcome to contribute your own papers if you feel the scope is too restrctive.
  * try NOT to suggest additional materials - the paper is about methods and not an actual validation report.
* Please log an **issue** in this repo if you have a strong opinion or feel there is a blunder of some sort
